# Wallet Email Validation - Test Guide

## ✅ What's Been Added

The system now **prevents RSVPs** when users have wallet-based temporary email addresses and provides a clear error message.

### New Validation Logic

When a user tries to create an RSVP, the system now checks:

1. **User has an email address**
2. **Email is not a wallet temp address** (doesn't contain `@wallet.temp`)
3. **Email format is valid**

If any of these fail, the RSVP creation is blocked with a clear error message.

## 🧪 Testing the Validation

### Test Case 1: Wallet Email (Should Fail)
```bash
# User with wallet email: 0xa635b319a6bec867167331ef3b8578887a8d4397@wallet.temp
POST /api/rsvp
{
  "eventId": "63c64bb1-4479-4c84-8845-d182616a9d9c",
  "status": "attending",
  "guestCount": 1
}

# Expected Response:
{
  "status": "error",
  "message": "No valid email found for this user. Please update your email address to receive RSVP confirmations and event notifications."
}
```

### Test Case 2: Valid Email (Should Succeed)
```bash
# User with real email: shoagasraful4231@gmail.com
POST /api/rsvp
{
  "eventId": "63c64bb1-4479-4c84-8845-d182616a9d9c", 
  "status": "attending",
  "guestCount": 1
}

# Expected Response:
{
  "status": "success",
  "message": "RSVP created successfully",
  "data": { ... }
}
```

## 🔍 Debug Endpoints Enhanced

### Check Current User
```bash
GET /api/rsvp/debug/current-user

# Response will show:
{
  "data": {
    "user": {
      "email": "0xa635b319a6bec867167331ef3b8578887a8d4397@wallet.temp",
      "emailValid": false,
      "isWalletEmail": true
    },
    "recommendations": [
      "User is using a wallet-based temporary email address. Consider updating to a real email address to receive notifications."
    ]
  }
}
```

### Debug RSVP Email Issues
```bash
GET /api/rsvp/:rsvpId/email-debug

# For wallet emails, will show:
{
  "recommendations": [
    "🚨 WALLET EMAIL DETECTED: User is using a temporary wallet email address (0xa635b319a6bec867167331ef3b8578887a8d4397@wallet.temp). This is why emails aren't being received. The system now blocks RSVPs with wallet emails. User must update to a real email address."
  ]
}
```

## 🎯 Frontend Impact

### Before (What Was Happening)
1. User with wallet email creates RSVP ✅
2. System tries to send email to `@wallet.temp` ✅
3. Email appears to send successfully ✅
4. User never receives email ❌
5. User confused why no email arrived ❌

### After (What Happens Now)
1. User with wallet email tries to create RSVP ❌
2. System immediately blocks the request ✅
3. Clear error message shown to user ✅
4. User knows they need to update their email ✅
5. No fake email attempts ✅

## 📱 Frontend Error Handling

Your frontend should handle the new error response:

```javascript
// Example frontend code
try {
  const response = await fetch('/api/rsvp', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(rsvpData)
  });

  const result = await response.json();

  if (!response.ok) {
    if (result.message.includes('No valid email found')) {
      // Show email update prompt
      showEmailUpdateModal();
    } else {
      // Handle other errors
      showError(result.message);
    }
  }
} catch (error) {
  console.error('RSVP creation failed:', error);
}
```

## 🛠️ User Email Update Flow

Users with wallet emails will need to:

1. **Update their profile** with a real email address
2. **Verify the email** (if verification is required)
3. **Try RSVP again** with the updated email

## 🚀 Benefits

✅ **No more fake email attempts**
✅ **Clear user feedback** about the issue
✅ **Prevents confusion** about missing emails
✅ **Forces users to provide real emails**
✅ **Better user experience** overall

## 📊 Expected Behavior

- **Wallet emails**: RSVP blocked with clear message
- **Real emails**: RSVP works normally with email confirmation
- **Invalid emails**: RSVP blocked with validation error
- **No email**: RSVP blocked with authentication error

The system now provides a much better user experience by catching the email issue upfront rather than silently failing to deliver emails.
